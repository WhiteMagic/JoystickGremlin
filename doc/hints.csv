"cycle-modes","<p>Allows switching between an arbitrary set of modes.</p><p>Modes can be added to the list, ordered as desired, and removed.</p>"
"description","<p>Allows adding a description to a container</p>"
"macro","<p>Permits recording of keyboard sequences as a macro.</p><p>A macro can be executed in <i>exclusive</i> mode which means no other macro will run at the same time. Additionally three repeat modes exist: <i>count, toggle,</i> and <i>hold</i>.</p><p>Macro actions can be rearranged via drag & drop as well as changed on an individual basis.</p>"
"map-to-keyboard","<p>Allows mapping of inputs to a single or sequence of keys to be pressed at the same time. The keys are held as long as the original physical inputs are held down.</p>"
"map-to-mouse","<p>Allows mapping of inputs to control mouse movements.</p>"
"noop","<p>This actions is a no operation, i.e. it doesn't do anything and can be used as a placeholder for when an action is needed, but none is wanted.</p>"
"pause","<p>Pauses the execution of any Gremlin callbacks.</p><p>When pause only inputs marked with <i>Always execute</i> will run.</p>"
"play-sound","<p>Plays the specified sound file back, with the ability to modify the volume of the playback.</p>"
"previous-mode","<p>Switches to the previous mode.</p>"
"remap","<p>Permits remapping from a physical device input to a virtual joystick device.</p>"
"response-curve","<p>Permits the configuration of a response curve, changing the 1:1 mapping from physical deflection to reported deflection. Additionally the dead-zones of the axis can be configured.</p><p>The response curve is modified by adding new control points via a double left mouse click. Individual control points can be selected by clicking on them which allows their removal via the Del key and modifying them via the numerical inputs.</p>"
"resume","<p>Resumes execution of Gremlin callbacks if Gremlin was paused previously.</p><p>For this action to work the inputs <i>Always execute</i> option has to be enabled.</p>"
"split-axis","<p>Permits splitting of a single physical axis into two virtual ones.</p><p>The value at which an axis is split can be configured via the slider. If there is a need to apply a dead-zone or response curve to the split axis, then this has to be added via the vJoy tab of the corresponding vJoy device.</p>"
"switch-mode","<p>Changes to the designated mode.</p>"
"text-to-speech","<p>Plays the entered text via Window's text to speech system.</p>"
"toggle-pause","<p>Pauses and resumes Gremlin.</p><p>For this action to work the inputs <i>Always execute</i> option has to be enabled.</p>"
"axis-condition","<p>Turns an axis into a button.</p><p>The virtual button is pressed once the axis enters the range and is released upon leaving the range.</p>"
"hat-condition","<p>Treats a hat as possibly eight individual buttons.</p><p>A virtual hat button can be made up of any combination of directions. The virtual button is pressed once any of the selected directions is pressed and released once none of the selected directions is pressed.</p>"
"basic","<p>Holds a single set of actions that are all executed simultaneously.</p>"
"tempo","<p>Holds two sets of actions, the first one is executed only on a short press, specified by the delay. The second set is only executed when the input is held longer then the specified delay.</p>"
"chain","<p>Holds an arbitrary number of action sets, each of which is executed on subsequent activations of the input. The sequence can optionally reset after a specified timeout with no activations.</p>"
"cond:granularity","Configure granularity of condition configuration. <dl><dt>None</dt><dd>No conditions.</dd><dt>Action</dt><dd>Individual conditions for each action.</dd><dt>Container</dt><dd>Conditions are applied to all actions within a container.</dd></dl>"
"cond:types","Different types of conditions can be checked for. <dl><dt>Keyboard</dt><dd>Permits using state of keyboard keys as condition.</dd><dt>Joystick</dt><dd>Permits using axis ranges, button states, and hat directions as conditions</dd><dt>Action</dt><dd>Permits using the pressing or releasing of the physical button as a condition. This also works for virtual buttons.</dd></dl>
