This is Star Citizen profile using a CH Fighterstick, CH Pro Pedals and
keyboard.

The files in this folder serve the following purposes:
- empty.xml clears all flight related inputs in Star Citizen
- jkb.xml Star Citizen bindings that work with this profile
- profile.xml the profile file to load in Joystick Gremlin
- sc.py the custom module used by Joystick Gremlin to provide additional
  functionality

The profile itself does simple remapping of all inputs to a single VJoy
device with some additional functionality defined in the custom sc
module.

The module provides the following:
- Two sensitivity curves, one for normal flight and another one which is
  activated when the guns are fired. This provides a form of ESP but
  with direct user control over when it is active.
- Set of macros that map the hat directions to shield commands.
- Macros that deploy either flare or chaff on a single button press
  without having to switch between countermeasure modes.
- Code to combine the two pedal motions into a single axis, which is
  used to control the trottle in coupled and longitudinal strafe in
  decoupled mode.
- A set of macros which sets the throttle to 0%, 33%, 66% and 100% using
  the keys 1 through 4 on the keyboard.
